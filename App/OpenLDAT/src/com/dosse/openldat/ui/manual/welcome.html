<center><h4>Welcome to OpenLDAT!</h4></center>
<p>OpenLDAT is the free and open source tool for measuring display and system latency metrics.</p>
<p>For the best results, follow these tips:<ul>
    <li>Run all tests in a dark room, with no lights around you</li>
    <li>Keep the device perfectly still while the tests are running</li>
    <li>Set the backlight brightness to 100%</li>
    <li>Disable dynamic contrast, local dimming, ambient light sensors, power saving, etc.</li>
    <li>Disable any kind of picture enhancement on your monitor and video driver</li>
    <li>If you're using a TV, make sure it's set to Game Mode for lower latency</li>
    <li>Disable any overlay or capture software such as MSI Afterburner, Xbox Game Bar, NVIDIA Shadowplay, etc.</li>
    <li>Set the monitor to its native refresh rate</li>
    <li>Always use full range RGB (8 bit or 10 bit)</li>
    <li>Do not force VSync on or off from your video driver settings, let the application control it</li>
    <li>Don't have multiple displays connected to this machine</li>
    <li>Connect the display directly to the machine, avoid streaming over the network</li>
</ul></p>
