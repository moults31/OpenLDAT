<p>
    Pixel Response Time is the time it takes for a pixel to transition from a color to another.<br/>
    This test measures the transition times between black and white, as well as between several shades of grey.<br/>
    This test takes 1-3 minutes to complete depending on the chosen settings.<br/><br/>
    The following settings can be changed:<ul>
    <li><b>Evaluation method</b>: which range of the transition should be considered. Two options are available:<ul>
            <li><b>VESA Standard</b>: the gold standard, considers the range between 10% and 90%. Not often used by manufacturers outside of professional monitors.</li>
            <li><b>BS Manufacturers Say</b>: a completely arbitrary range of 30% to 70% typically used by manufacturers, especially in the gaming industry.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>Step size</b>: smaller steps means that more shades of grey are tested, but the test will take longer. Possible values are 16 (slowest), 32 (balanced), 64 (fast).</li>
</ul>

<h6>PWM, Strobing and other noise</h6>
<p>
The accuracy of this test is reduced if PWM backlights are used or some other similar noise is present. If possible, it should be turned off to get better results.
