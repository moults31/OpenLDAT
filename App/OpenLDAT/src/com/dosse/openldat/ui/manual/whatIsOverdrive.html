<h2>What is Pixel Overdrive?</h2>
<p>
Pixel Overdrive is a technique typically used to improve Pixel Response Time in gaming monitors. The basic idea is that if a pixel needs to transition from a value A to a brigher value B, it will transition more quickly if we overshoot B for a short time (or undershoot it if B is darker than A). Excessive overdrive creates inverse ghosting artifacts, visible as trails or halos around moving objects.

The following pictures show a transition between two dark shades of grey on the same display with different overdrive settings (X axis is time, Y axis is brightness):
<center><table border="!AUTO!1">
<tr><th width="33%">No overdrive</th><th width="33%">Medium</th><th width="33%">Strong</th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="od_off.png" width="!AUTO!106.67" height="!AUTO!80"/></td><td><img src="od_medium.png" width="!AUTO!106.67" height="!AUTO!80"/></td><td><img src="od_strong.png" width="!AUTO!106.67" height="!AUTO!80"/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Notice the long transition</td><td>Notice the much faster transition</td><td>Notice the spike during the transition, this is visible to the user</td></tr>
